# TypeScript Course Project

This repository contains the source code and materials for a **TypeScript course**.  
It is designed to help you learn and practice TypeScript fundamentals, advanced features, and real-world applications.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest **LTS** version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes bundled with Node.js)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Dependencies

The project will make use of:

- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **ts-node** – Run TypeScript files directly without compiling.
- **nodemon** – Auto-restart development server on file changes.
- **ESLint** – Linting utility to enforce best practices.
- **Prettier** – Code formatter for consistent style.
